abstract = "An extensive literature on partisan gatekeeping argues that majority parties use negative agenda control to prevent bills that divide their parties from coming up for a vote. Despite this, majority party
rolls – bills that pass despite being opposed by a majority of the majority – are routinely observed. We use newly collected bill- and roll call-level data from state legislatures to understand when and why majority
parties get rolled. Three main findings emerge. First, there is a stark and consistent partisan difference in roll rates. Republican majorities get rolled approximately three times as frequently as Democratic
majorities, and most of these rolls occur on legislation that is sponsored exclusively by the minority party rather than in a bipartisan fashion. Second, spatial factors are an important predictor of variation
in roll rates. Moderate bills (relative to majorities) are more likely to roll majorities. Here, too, we find partisan differences with Republican majorities much more subject to this effect. Finally, lobbying
disclosure data from three states reveal that majority party rolls are more common on bills supported by lobbying from organized interests, suggesting that outside actors are capable of overcoming partisan
gatekeeping. Together, these results provide a clearer picture of how parties wield agenda power."
