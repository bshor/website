abstract = "Median voter and party cartel theories of legislative organization predict or assume that elected party leaders will be centrists with respect to their constituency, the party caucus. Yet most recent empirical studies of leader positioning find that elected leaders are in fact extremists. Such studies are exclusively tested in Congress, and that limits the papers' analytical power and the external validity of the conclusions drawn. This paper features an original data set combining state legislative leadership data with an updated data set on state legislative ideology, with 2,476 unique leaders in 50 states from 1993-2022. Using Monte Carlo simulations to assess the possibility of nonrandom (centrist and extreme) leadership selection, state leaders are found to be overwhelmingly centrist. The story is more nuanced when it comes to which side of the party medians leaders come from. Democrats typically come from the left side of their party, while Republicans are split, being located on the right side only in the lower chamber and actually on the left side in the upper chamber. Models predicting the size of the divergence between leaders and their caucuses implicate intraparty heterogeneity and polarization as strong predictors."
